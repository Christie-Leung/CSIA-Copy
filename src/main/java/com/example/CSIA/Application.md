With technological advancements improving exponentially, the issue of artificial intelligence and human cloning becomes surreal. Through the play, A Number, Caryl Churchill approaches the topic, raising ethical discussions in the minds of its audiences. Without ever mentioning “clones,” Churchill’s play describes the life of a dad, Salter, and the effects of his decision to clone his son, B1. When his cloned son, B2 is first introduced to B1, Salter is faced with the consequences of his actions, causing him to realize and learn of what he truly wants or loves. Concerning the minimal stage directions and omission of punctuations in the play script, directors and actors are left with their own imagination, leading to many variations of the play with unique implications. Nonetheless, the debate of whether a clone should deserve the same values of a human or whether cloning a human is ethical is continually rising. Thus, throughout the play, Churchill carefully manipulates diction to discuss the significance of the ethical issue, using deictics, repetition and categorization to further emphasis her opinion in this topic.

By using indefinite words, Churchill is able to completely avoid stating the word “clone” anywhere in the book as if it is a forbidden word. This places an ambiguous connotation, leaning more towards the negative side and providing to the mystic mood. Right from the beginning, the writer uses broad terms to develop a sense of distance from the idea as if it is very far-reaching:

	Salter: it is, I am, the shocking thing is that there are these, not how many but at all
	B2: even one
	SALTER: exactly, even one, a twin would be a shock
	B2: a twin would be a surprise but a number
	SALTER: a number any number is a shock.
	B2: You said things, these things
	SALTER: I said?
	B2: you called them things. I think we’ll find they’re people
	
	
By using deictics like “things” and “these,” it is setting an atmosphere similar to that of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series where Voldemort is also known as “the one who shall not be named.” Although, through the series, it was clearly stated as to who “the one who shall not be named” is, Churchill is seen to be playing mind games with its audience and forcing them to figure out what it is -- and why it is so "terrifying" that no one dares say the word. The author places subtle hints like "I think we'll find they're people" and "because they're copies"(11) to lead them towards an answer. As Albert Einstein has said, “The important thing is to not stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing,” stating that it is simply human nature to be curious. Through these specific words, the author is hoping for audiences to link them together while also getting the sense of how human cloning is not to be reckoned with. 

Moreover, Churchill utilizes the art of mathematics in order to emphasis on the atmosphere that is far from usual. Naturally, humans are differentiated from one another by names or personalities or hair colour or eye colour -- something that can be easily used to describe a specified individual. Though, as seen with the naming system throughout the script, Salter’s sons are named B1 and B2, showing a lack of compassion towards these characters and stripping the uniqueness from "humans." A counterclaim to this explanation of how since they are both named Bernard, it was just an easier way to describe them, would be very relevant. However, the author could instead write “Bernard 1” and “Bernard 2.” Without the name, it makes them sound like test subjects where these indistinct descriptors are needed as anonymity is often required through research, further implying how clones shouldn't have human values because they will always be different from a natural human being. Other than that, age, when used to describe a person, may come off as being rude. However, when Salter asked B2 about who was responsible for the cloning process, he replied with "Just some young... younger than me." By using age as a descriptor, not only does it place a quantitative value on a human, devaluing people into objects, but also show the assumption factor. In our society, it is impolite to assume another's age. While in this example, the age range is not specified, it still showcases how Churchill wants the audiences to see how they do not have the same respect for humans and will not have the same degree of sympathy. Although the last clone, Michael Black, may seem to be very different from Salter's two sons, as he has a more cheerful character, he still leans towards a mathematical approach: 

	MICHAEL: We’ve got ninety-nine per cent the same genes as any other person. We’ve got ninety per cent the same as a chimpanzee. We’ve got thirty percent the same as a lettuce… (62)

This quote is quite interesting as Churchill essentially strip humans into the most basic unit -- genes. Although all human beings have distinct DNA, she chose to discuss genes and use this as a comparison to other organisms. This way, everyone would be mostly similar from one another and have a broader definition of "human beings." 


Finally, Churchill experiments with repetitions and can be seen to have two crucial meanings when used. As the obvious, repetition can be used to place emphasis on an idea. During Salter's conversation with B1, repetition was heavily used by B1 as he continually demands attention from his father:

	B1: When I was there in the dark. I'd be shouting.
	SALTER: No.
	B1: Yes I'd be shouting dad dad
	SALTER: Was this some time you had a bad dream or?
	B1: shouting on and on
	SALTER: I don't think I
	B1: shouting and shouting
	(31)

Salter was firm in his position to stay in denial of how B1 used to shout every night. And it was through this repetition that he was able to enforce his idea -- tricking his mind into thinking he did not hear any screams. He did not want to take the consequences of his action. The reason of cloning his son, was to avoid the reality, allowing Churchill to discuss another topic to the ethical issues linked to human cloning. 

When Salter did admit to his mistakes and told the truth to B2, the first meaning of repetition fails. As his mind was open and was willingly to let the truth sink in, Salter did try to sugarcoat the truth:

	SALTER: I was good I tried to be good I was good to you
	B2: that's what you were like
	SALTER: I was good

Through the tone of these phrases, Salter's attitude changes, and the devaluation of the term "good" occurs. Without context, "good" sounds positive. But with too much emphasis, the idea fades because one loses focus to the initial meaning. It slowly becomes a common sound rather than a word. No matter how hard Salter tries to enforce his thoughts, he realizes the effects of his choice -- cloning his son to live in his imaginations. If everyone in the world was to clone someone just to live in their fantasies, the problems with natural human interactions would occur.

If the world was without anger, without disappointment, without sadness, how would one know if they are happy? Churchill's creative stylistic choices in A Number has brought the upbringing issues of human cloning into the spotlight. In the play, the idea of clones portrayed as forbidden through the omission of diction. Additionally, the indefinite nouns and mathematical approaches utilized shows how clones have no compassion towards humanity and the nature of human beings. Furthermore, repetition illustrated the fear of facing consequences as Salter refuses to admit to the truth. Choosing to live in a fantasy world can lead to a very unrealistic approaches towards life; and if clones can help establish the idea of staying in imagination forever, the nature of human may be lost as too much repetition, as analyzed in the story, can cause thoughts to lose real meanings. In the end, this play brings important arguments toward the issue concerning human cloning and leads me to my final question, would you rather experience all emotions and know what happiness feels like or stay happy your entire life?
